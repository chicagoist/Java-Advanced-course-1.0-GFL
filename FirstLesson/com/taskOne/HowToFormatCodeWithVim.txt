vim -c "execute 'normal! =G' | :wq! out.js" input.js

You can also use the alternative syntax + instead of -c. It's the same.

vim +"execute 'normal! =G' | :wq! out.js" input.js

    It executes the normal command =G, which will autoformat/indent (=) every line until the end of the file (G).

    Then :wq! out.js writes it to a file and quits vim. If you just want to overwrite the same file, then remove the out.js.

Also, you need to have this line in your ~/.vimrc in order for the autoformat indent plugin to work:

filetype plugin indent on

If you like vim you can invoke its action from the command-line.

echo -e "G=gg\n:wq\n" | vim ./HelloWorld.java

Warning the above command will modify your file without prompting. Do a backup before.
It's possible to find examples integrated with find to accomplish the same work on a bunch of files [0].
